It shows under a raster form modelled spatial distributions of Posidonia oceanica across the Mediterranean Sea.

While its distribution is well documented along the European shores of the western Mediterranean Sea, limited information is available about the southern shore and the eastern Mediterranean Sea. In order to bridge this information gap, one of the goals of Task 1.3 of the MEDISEH project was to model P. oceanica distribution across the whole Mediterranean basin.\n",
